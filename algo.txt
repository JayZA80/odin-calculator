(Add function)
Declare a function that takes two numbers as parameters (x, y)
Return the result of x + y

(Subtract function)
Declare a function that takes two numbers as parameters (x, y)
Return the result of x - y

(Multiply function)
Declare a function that takes two numbers as parameters (x, y)
